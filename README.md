# Linear Search in C

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the **Linear Search algorithm** in the C programming language. Linear Search is a basic searching technique used to find the position of a specific element within an array.

## What is Linear Search?

Linear Search sequentially checks each element of the array until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached. Itâ€™s simple but not the most efficient for large datasets.

## Features

- Accept user input for array elements and search target
- Perform linear search and display index if found
- Display a "not found" message if the element is not in the array
- Simple and clear code for educational purposes

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC or any standard C compiler
- **Libraries**: `stdio.h`
